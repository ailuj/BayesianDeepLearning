    "Despite the fact that the most accurate default prediction models aren't the most profitable (Lessmann et al (2015)), the literature on the profit rate prediction (i.e. Profit Scoring) is relatively scarcer than in the previous case. One of the first papers that implemented this approach was Andreeva et al (2007) who defined a model that shows improvement in the profit by application of revenue predicting models with a survival probability of default compared to \"static probability\" in case of the store card for white durable goods. Some of the papers that deal with Profit Scoring are Bayraci (2017) who uses multiple machine learning techniques to predict the default rate, but on top of that utilizes Expected Maximum Profit framework introduced by Verbraken et al (2014) to find the profit-maximizing cutoff and evaluate the models. Bastani et al. (2018) propose a two-step scoring approach based on both default probability prediction and profit scoring in the case of the peer-to-peer lending market. They argue that the combination of both methods is necessary as the default probability ignores profit and profit based one ignores class imbalance. Cinca and Nieto (2016) propose a profit scoring for peer-to-peer lending and show that it is possible to obtain a higher profit by using profit based measures than more standard default probabilities one. They use the Internal Rate of Return as a profitability measure and provide a decision support system for selecting the most profitable loan applicants. Finlay (2008) proposes a continuous model of customer worth for lender. By using logistic and linear regression he shows that these measures outperform the classification based ones when loan applications are ranked by their worth to lenders. Barrios et al (2014) introduced absolute and relative profit measures for consumer credits and showed that their novel scorecards outperform traditional ones regarding the portfolio returns.\n",

    "Some research in the context of Bayesian models in finance area was done under Shah and Zhang (2014) where they predicted Bitcoin price with Bayesian regression and defined a successful trading strategy that almost doubles the returns compared to the benchmark. Pires and Marwala (2007) used Automatic Relevance Determination and Hybrid Monte Carlo method for Bayesian Neural Networks in order to predict the call option price with stock volatility, strike price and time to maturity as independent variables. Moreira et al. (2017) proposed quantum-like inference of Bayesian network in comparison to the classical one in order to deal with the issue of missing data in the context of bank loans and shows critical improvement in terms of error under quantum-like inference model. \n",

    "However, to our best knowledge, no study implemented a Bayesian Deep Learning framework to this matter or used a similar measurement to make a loan decision."
